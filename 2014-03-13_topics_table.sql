The agricultural subsidy program was created to alleviate the stress on poorly performing farms. However, with the bulk of the stipend going to the top 10 % of some of the largest farms, many think that the agricultural subsidies are more harmful than helpful. The subsidies also incite farms to overproduce, which drives the food prices down and increases farm reliance on governmental subsidies.

Supporting the public consensus, the Federal Election Campaign Act, or FECA of 1972, limited individual contributions from wealthy individuals to 1000 or 5000 dollars. This limited the influence of the wealthy individuals. However, donations to individual parties by sponsor corporations, i.e. not as an advocate of the winning and losing of elections by a candidate, is still allowed. In the 2002 case, the Supreme Court cited free speech and ruled in favor of the corporations to make unrestricted ‘soft’ money donations to corporations. The public has been attempting to bring finance reform while the status quo has been maintained in terms of sponsoring of the parties and, thus, by extension candidates.

For instance, Senate Bill 353 passed two sweeping abortion restrictions which along with making the streets safer for motorcyclists in North Carolina removed insurance of abortions for city and county employees, as well as from the state’s federal health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act. Ohio is also restricting access to the abortion with increased taxation. It is not enough to provide access to abortion with costs running upwards of eight thousand dollars.

However, in recent years the focus of Chinese investors has started to shift to North America and Europe. Since 2009, Chinese direct investment in America and Europe has increased sharply, and developed economy-bound flows are poised to grow heavily through 2020, according to Rhodium Group estimates. Policymakers are still grappling with the proper policy response, but significant progress has been made in the United States over the past two years. The key impediments Chinese firms face when setting up US shops are inexperience and lack of capabilities rather than political shenanigans. For American businesses, the growth of Chinese investment does pose certain risks, most importantly new competition at home and abroad, but it also brings invaluable new opportunities, such as divestment of assets, co-investment, and new business opportunities in China.',0,100000000000003,3,0,0,0,'2014-04-01 00:00:00','2013-09-08 06:58:24','2013-09-08 06:58:24'),(25,'With DOMA struck down what are the remaining hurdles for gay rights in America?','The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is a United States federal law that allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states.

Majority of Republicans oppose stricter laws on who can own drugs, deeper background searches on gun owners and a ban on assault rifles. The argument they present is gun control is against the Second Amendment to the Constitution and violates the right of citizens to own weapons.

It was seen as an individual right to “bear arms” with a collective responsibility for all men of the proscribed age to defend themselves and their state . They argue the \"well regulated militia\" clause clearly means the right to bear arms should only be given to these organized groups.
