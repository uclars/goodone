Grant was determined to end the war by eliminating Lee\'s Army of Northern Virginia, either by outmaneuvering and trapping it or by exploiting the North\'s superior manpower to trade casualties with it until Lee\'s numbers were exhausted.

As Guy Emery writes, Lee\'s experience told him that the Union had placed too many men on the flanks, and had left the center extremely vulnerable. Lee correctly estimated that the strength at the Union center must have been no more than five thousand men (137). His plan was to bombard the Union center with heavy artillery strikes, further weakening it, leaving just enough artillery to support the troops when they began the charge.

Many of the workers in the office where I work are single women in their 20s or 30s, so I haven\'t been thinking in getting married so seriously until now. \r\n\r\nBut recently two of my intimate friends got married. I thought, \"Well, when will I get married?\", but I can\'t imagine myself got married, though I had imagined when I was a child that I would have had a baby at my 30 years old! \r\n\r\nIf you are a single woman who wants to get married but actually not, let\'s talk together about what\'s wrong with us!\r\n\r\nAre our standard too high?

She is in her late 40\'s and she believes she is good at her job. The way she answers the phone, or other basic skills are good, but she makes a lot of mistakes when it comes to her main job which is to input data. The way she works is slow, and she is not as good as she thinks. \r\n\r\nWhen I point out her mistakes, she says that she didn\'t use such software at her pervious office, and uses that as an excuse. She shows no signs of listening or correcting her mistake, in fact she gets into a bad mood when I mention about her mistakes, in worst cases she simply ignores me. \r\n\r\nI am not sure how to handle her and this situation.',5,0,1,0,'2012-06-08 00:00:00','2012-06-08 00:00:00'),(13,100000000000050,'Should I ask him whether he is going to marry me?','Hi,\r\nI am forty years old.
